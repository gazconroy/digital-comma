I"»<p>Static sites work best if most of the pages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have aÂ low degree of user interactivity</li>
  <li>Do not update frequently</li>
</ul>

<p>This is typically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blogs</li>
  <li>Informational sites</li>
  <li>Landing pages</li>
  <li>Selling pages</li>
  <li>Company pages</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Portfolio</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="some-benefits-of-static-sites">Some benefits of static sites</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance.</strong>  Static sites are fast. There is no server-side processing and no database to connect to, meaning that there is nothing to slow the process of getting a page from the server to your end user</li>
  <li><strong>Security.</strong> Static sites are immune to the most common attacks, as they do not contain dynamic content: there are no server-side language issues to exploit and no database to hack</li>
  <li><strong>Content versioning.</strong> Since your entire site, from configuration to content, is file-based, it is very easy to keep all aspects of it within a version control system like Git.</li>
  <li><strong>Previewable.</strong> Because static sites are developed locally, you can play around with that local site without affecting the live site.</li>
  <li><strong>Hosting.</strong> Since no server-side language is required, hosting doesnâ€™t require complicated setup or maintenance, making it cheap and easy. In fact, there are even free options, like GitHub pages.</li>
</ul>
