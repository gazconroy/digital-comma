excerpt: There are a plethora of systems that you can use but many carry a cost and, for open-source software, that's often a deal-breaker

There are a few excellent options to choose from, each with individual strengths and features. Whatever your budget, I'd say that there's no such thing as a perfect OAS3 (Open API 3 specification) documentation tool. You need to decide what's most important to you and accept the compromises you must make.

Note that I'm only considering Open API **3** tools here so will not cover Open API 2 tools like *Dapperdox* and *Apiary*.

## Key

- **OAS editor** - includes its own Open API editing tool
- **Try it out** - allows users to test API calls within the tool?
- **Layout** - does this adopt the [Stripe API style](https://stripe.com/docs/api) three-column layout or the [Swagger style](https://petstore.swagger.io/) one column expandable layout
- **Self-host or custom domain?** - can you deploy this on your servers (*Self-host*) or point the hosted service to your domain (*Custom domain*)
- **Automated code outputs** - how many types of output can the tool generate for API requests. Note that this does not include manually-generated code injected into the Open API specification (such as Redoc's, admittedly excellent, *x-codeSamples* extension)
- **Expandable schemas** - JSON structures can get complicated. Does the tool allow you to collapse and expand the schemas so you can see as much detail as you wish?
- **Git integration** - what is the nature of any integration with Git repositories
- **Collaborative?** - does this have features to allow more than one person to work on the same specification concurrently?


# What if you are willing to 'splash the cash'

The commercial realm often offers far more than the free options: code generation, extended documentation tools, integration with Git repositories, version control, advanced Open API editing, multi-user collaboration, mocking servers and so on. The standouts for me being:

- **[Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/welcome)** - for its unparalleled Open API editor and intelligent integration with Git repositories
- **[SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/)** - for its integrated tooling (SmartBear/SwaggerHub is Open API central, after all)
- **[ReadMe](https://readme.com/)** - for its complete, consistent and attractive documentation suite.

## Key

As above, plus:

- **Cost (from)** - this is the cost for at least one *published* API. Quite a few of these commercial tools will let you develop an Open API specification for free but you need to pay if you want to allow public access to it
- **Other documentation tools** - this article is specifically looking at these systems as documentation tools. Outside of the Open API specification does the system provide other documentation tools?
