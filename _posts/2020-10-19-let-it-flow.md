## ![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/important.jpg){: .align-right} Make a SharePoint list

First choose a site that will host your ‘workbench’ list (for instance, a hub site may be a good location).

Create a list and call it ‘Workbench’ with the fields:
- **Title** – (the default field)
- **Page** – Hyperlink
- **PageID** – Number
- **Author** – Person
- **Approval request** – Single line of text
- **Approver** – Person
- **Request time/date** – Date and time
- **Comments** – Multiple lines of text
- **Etag** – Single line of text
- **Processed** – Single line of text

Make sure that all your authors have 'Owner' access to the workbench list.
